# fakeizen
 Paper plugin that fakes Denizen server online status

# Usage
- Drop plugin release in plugins folder
- Use `/fakeizen submit` instead of `/denizen submit` command and your server status in logs will be showed as online one no matter the reality (this plugin will be not showed in list)

# Why?
Because I consider it's not cool to refuse support (even not Denizen specified) because of server offline stauts.
